
1 ) The execution file ( AA_RUN_THIS_FILE.m) runs the program. You will need to fill out the top
rows where is says ' FILL oUT' with file locations on your harddrive and FILE names (For saving excel sheets etc) 

2) The FOLDER labeled 'TRAIL DATA' contains sample STL files which can be used as an example. In order to do this you
must specficy the location of the STL files in the Execution_File.m The STL files have been all named in order to run with the file
(The STL file names can be changed howeever, the appropriate adjustments must then be made in the Execution_FILE.m) 

3) After you have succesfully run the AA_RUN_THIS_FILE.m with out errors the excel file will output all of the BSIP infomration of the STL files.
